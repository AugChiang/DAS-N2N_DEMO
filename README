# The Demo of DAS-N2N Denoising Model

The model is finetuned from [https://github.com/sachalapins/DAS-N2N](https://github.com/sachalapins/DAS-N2N) which is originally trained with **Rutford Ice Stream** in **Antarctica**. [paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08120)

Our data is recorded in Taichung Powe Plant and is used to finetune the DAS-N2N model for denoising.

## Data
- date: 2023.11.21
- shape: (30000,2132) along temporal and spatial axis. While DAS-N2N model accepts the input shape of (128,96), therefore, we slice ours into a block of the shape (2585, 128, 96).

## Finetune
Following the training process of the original paper, the only pre-processing step applied is the z-score normalization. 
We finetuned the whole DAS-N2N model with 31 records of our DAS data, iterating for 1 epoch.
